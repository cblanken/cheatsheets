# Git

## Logs

```shell
git log --oneline # concise output with a truncated hash and commit message
```

## Commits

- Rules to live by
  - Don't end commit messages with a period (`.`)
  - Keep commit messages under 50 characters
  - Use active voice (e.g. "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged")
  - Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change

```shell
git commit # open default editor to write commit message
git commit -m "message" # commit with "message"
```
