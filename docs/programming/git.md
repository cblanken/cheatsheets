### Logs

git log --oneline
```

### Commits
* Rules to live by ðŸ™ƒ
    * Don't end commit messages with a period (.)
    * Keep commit messages to 50 chars or less.
    * Use active voice (e.g. "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged")
    * Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change

```git
# commit staged files with short 'message'
git commit -m "message"
```
